React component wrappers around Google's Material Design Lite library

## Requirements

Before using, default pages should have the MDL files loaded:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://code.getmdl.io/1.2.1/material.indigo-pink.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
```

## Usage

The goal of RMDL is to keep it simple when creating an element? and leverage the parent/child relationship of react.
